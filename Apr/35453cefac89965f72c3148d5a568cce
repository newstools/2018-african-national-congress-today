The Solidarity group For Peace and Justice and The British Tamil Forum pass their deepest condolences on the passing away of our mother NOMZAMO WINIFRED MADIKIZELA-MANDELA. God bless you Comrade Winnie, We want to thank you for the sacrifice you made for our beloved country. How can we forget what the apartheid government had done to you?
They did everything to destroy your spirit, banished you to a desolate Brandford in the Orange Free State, there was no running water or electricity. They kept you in solitary confinement for 491 days….but those Apartheid savages could not break your spirit. You made us proud when Nelson Mandela was imprisoned and you never gave up the struggle, you fought against all odds, never comprising the ANC principles.
We are proud to be born in the era of the world’s greatest statesman in this century, Nelson Mandela and you Comrade Winnie……MAY YOUR SOUL REST IN PEACE. Yours faithfully Dees Pillay
